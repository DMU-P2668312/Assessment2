      Kuchipudi is one of the eight major Indian classical dances.
      It originates from a village named Kuchipudi in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.
      <br><br>
      Kuchipudi is a dance-drama performance, with its roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra.
      It developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs,
      like all major classical dances of India. Evidence of Kuchipudi's existence in an older version are found in
      copper inscriptions of the 10th century, and by the 15th century in texts such as the Machupalli Kaifat.
      Kuchipudi tradition holds that Tirtha Narayana Yati – a sanyassin of Advaita Vedanta persuasion,
      and his disciple, an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi, founded and systematized the modern version of
      Kuchipudi in the 17th century.Kuchipudi largely developed as a Krishna-oriented Vaishnavism tradition,
      and it is known by the name of Bhagavata Mela in Thanjavur.
      <br><br>
      The traditional Kuchipudi was performed by all males troupe. A dancer in a male role would be in Agnivastra,
      also known as Bagalbandi, wear a dhoti (a single pleated piece of cloth hanging down from the waist).
      A dancer in a female role would wear a Sari with light makeup.
      <br><br>
      The Kuchipudi performance usually begins with an invocation. Then, each costumed actor is introduced,
      their role stated, and they then perform a short preliminary dance set to music (dharavu).
      Next, the performance presents pure dance (nritta).
      This is followed with by the expressive part of the performance (nritya),
      where rhythmic hand gestures help convey the story.
      Vocal and instrumental Carnatic music in the Telugu language accompanies the performance.
      The typical musical instruments in Kuchipudi are mridangam, cymbals, veena, flute and the tambura.
      <br><br>
      The popularity of Kuchipudi has grown within India, and it is performed worldwide.

    <p>
      Bharatanatyam is a major Hindu form of Indian classical dance that originated in Tamil Nadu.
      The Natya Shastra by Bharata Muni and Abhinaya Darpana (Mirror of Gesture) by Nandikeshvara
      are considered to be the original sources one of Bharatanatyam (an Indian classical dance form).
      The dance form is also briefly mentioned in Kannada text Manasollasa written by Someshwara III.
      It has flourished in the temples and courts of southern India since ancient times.
      It is one of eight widely recognized Indian classical dance forms and it expresses South
      Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism,
      collectively Hinduism.
      <br><br>
      A description of Bharatanatyam from the 2nd century CE can be found in the ancient Tamil epic Silappatikaram,
      while temple sculptures of the 6th to 9th century CE suggest it was a highly refined performance art by the mid-1st millennium CE.
      Bharatanatyam is the oldest classical dance tradition in India.
      The dance form was prevalent in South India, and several books have codified it,
      such as the Natya Shastra by Bharata Muni (Sanskrit: भरत मुनि). Bharatanatyam is the state dance form of Tamil Nadu.
      <br><br>
      Bharatanatyam contains different types of banis. Bani, or 'tradition', is a term used to describe the dance technique and
      style specific to a guru or school. These are named according to the village of the guru (with the exception of some banis).
      Bharatanatyam style is noted for its fixed upper torso, bent legs and knees flexed (Aramandi) combined with spectacular footwork,
      and a sophisticated vocabulary of sign language based on gestures of hands, eyes, and face muscles.
      The dance is accompanied by music and a singer, and typically the dancer's guru is present as the Nattuvanar, director,
      and conductor of the performance and art. The dance has traditionally been a form of an interpretive narration of mythical
      legends and spiritual ideas from Hindu texts. The performance repertoire of Bharatanatyam, like other classical dances,
      includes nrita (pure dance), nritya (solo expressive dance) and natya (group dramatic dance).
      <br><br>
      Bharatanatyam remained exclusive to Hindu temples through the 19th century.
      It was banned by the colonial British government in 1910, but the Indian community protested
      against the ban and expanded its performance outside temples in the 20th century.
      Modern stage productions of Bharatanatyam has been spread out and popular throughout
      India that has been done in different ways and have incorporated technical performances,
      pure dance based on non-religious ideas and fusion themes.
